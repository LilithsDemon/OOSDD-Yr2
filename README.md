This program allows to translate morse code into text or vice versa.

You are allowed to select between different types of morse code, e.g. american or international

To add your own you can enter a new translation file in the Translations folder.

The format of input/output requires 2 spaces between each letter in morse code and a / to symbolise a space in the words

For example, Hello World would translate to using the internation standard:

····  ·  ·-··  ·-··  ---  /  ·--  ---  ·-·  ·-··  -··

This allows for American morse code which includes spaces to still work while keeping a simple standard.
